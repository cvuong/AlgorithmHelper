#### A note on style

Above all else, our writing should be understandable. We want readers to understand the core concepts of the topic as they read about it on their phones. Our guides are less about facts and more intuition. We prefer language-agnostic concepts rather than going into gritty implementation details. Writing a guide is a great way to understand something better!
